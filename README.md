## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
1. **Appwrite Setup**: ( https://appwrite.io/ )
   - Create a shiny new project in Appwrite.
   - Set up your authentication methods.
   - Configure your database collections (users and videos).
   - Create your indexes for the search functionality.

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Appwrite secrets:
     ```env
     APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://[YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT]
     APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
     APPWRITE_PLATFORM=""
     ```
     Example:
     ```
         export const config = {
         endpoint: process.env.APPWRITE_ENDPOINT ?? 'https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1',
         platform: process.env.PLATFORM ?? 'com.fabio.aora',
         projectId: process.env.APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID ?? '668c10800031fa4446cb',
         databaseId: '668c1175001c45a4c380',
         usersCollectionId: '668c119400208e92179d',

         storageId: '668c12de0026dfb652ad',
         };
   ```
2. **Notes**:
   I left my configuration so you can start the project easily but I advice you to create your own project in Appwrite.
